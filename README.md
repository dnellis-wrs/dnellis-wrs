- 👋 Hi, I’m @dnellis-wrs
- 👀 I’m interested in the back-end solution space.   AI, data science, and novel persistence technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end stackm stuff.   Both old and new css and jQuery to Vue.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who wants to do old things in a new and better way!
